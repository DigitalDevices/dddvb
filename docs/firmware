Firmware update:

Copy the firmware file to the dddvb/apps/ directory and
execute "./flashprog".

The program will try to identify the card version and
check if it finds the corresponding firmware file.
It will then prompt you to confirm to proceed
with the flashing procedure.

After the update the system needs a power cycle.
